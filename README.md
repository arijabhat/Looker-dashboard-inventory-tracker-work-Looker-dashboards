Converted 150+ looker dashboards and looks into a single point of truth and put the numbers down to around 30 dashboards & looks which resulted in operational efficiency &amp; cost reduction. Sorted out dashboards as per stakeholders convenience
In this project, I created & merged more than 150 dashboards into 30 single dashboards on Looker, in order to track KPIâ€™s & trends, organized by role & their significance for the leadership teams & high-level stakeholders which increased efficiency & reduced resource utilization cost.
Resolved data integrity issues faced by leadership with dashboards. Modified existing dashboards & created new dashboards on Looker which helped leadership teams to understand the patterns & trends easily.
